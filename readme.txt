In this paper, the models of the sodium, potassium, and calcium channels found in the hippocampal 
mossy fiber terminals were reconstructed according to the parameters described in the papers;
Engel D, Jonas P (2005) Presynaptic action potential amplification by voltage-gated Na+ channels in
 hippocampal mossy fiber boutons. Neuron 45: 405-17. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2004.12.048
and

 Ca2+ channels in hippocampal mossy fiber boutons. J. Neurosci.  27: 13420-9. https://www.jneurosci.org/content/27/49/13420
To test for the subthreshold axonal voltage signaling on spike propagation and transmitter release,
these models of axonal sodium, potassium, and calcium channel were implemented with
the structure model of mossy fiber and granule cells as described in;

To run the simulations, follow these steps:
Compile the mod files using nrnivmodl under Mac OS X and Linux, or mknrndll under Windows.
Run mosinit.hoc in NEURON.
Click the radiobuttons in the panel "Demo" and click "Init & Run" in the "RunControl" panel to run simulations.
